4th project of machine architecure course
my written code is in the following files:
el_malloc.c

can be ran through the terminal after compiling with the make file
info for make is within file, but pasted here for convenience
-> make                          # build all programs'
-> make clean                    # remove all compiled items'
-> make zip                      # create a zip file for submission'
-> make test                     # run all tests'
-> make test testnum=5           # run problem 1 test #5 only'

Built a custom malloc/free memory allocator in C using mmap, explicit doubly linked free lists, and boundary tags

REQUIRES to be ran on linux, or a linux container
